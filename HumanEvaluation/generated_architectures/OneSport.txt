### DESCRIPTION: 
The social_interaction container is designed to enhance the user experience by facilitating connections and interactions between users within the OneSport platform. It manages functionalities related to building and maintaining a user's social network by allowing them to send, accept, and reject friend requests. Users can check incoming friend requests, choose to add or remove friends from their list, and explore the details of other users by searching them through email. Additionally, the container supports viewing the user's friend list, ensuring users can easily keep track of and manage their social connections. This social aspect encourages user engagement and creates a community atmosphere around the shared interest in sports.

### PERSISTANCE EVALUATION
The social_interaction container needs to store data to fulfill its purpose and user stories. This includes information about friend requests, such as the sender, receiver, and the status of each request. The container also needs to maintain a list of friends for each user, recording both active friendships and deleted ones for potential auditing purposes. Additionally, the container should store data related to user searches and interactions, such as search queries by email, to potentially enhance user experience through analytics.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS
Based on the container's purpose and user stories, there is no immediate need for it to connect to external services. All functionalities related to managing social interactions among users can be internally handled within the OneSport platform. However, potential future enhancements might include integrations with social media platforms for friend suggestions or event sharing, but these are not currently required to meet the outlined user stories.

#### MICROSERVICE: social_network
- TYPE: backend
- DESCRIPTION: This microservice manages the core functionalities of social interactions among users. It oversees sending, accepting, and deleting friend requests, checking incoming requests, removing friends from the list, and searching for other users by email. Additionally, it handles viewing and maintaining the user's friend list while ensuring the smooth operation of these social features.
- PORTS: 8400
- TECHNOLOGICAL SPECIFICATION
The microservice "social_network" uses Python as its main programming language, leveraging the Flask framework to efficiently build and deploy RESTful APIs allowing scalable and organized management of social interactions. For the database interactions, SQLAlchemy is chosen as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library to handle database operations and to ensure a seamless interaction with the microservice "social_db". The persistance layer, "social_db", operates on PostgreSQL due to its robust support for complex queries and its ability to efficiently handle large datasets, which is crucial for tracking friend relations and searches.
- SERVICE ARCHITECTURE
The "social_network" service adopts a modular pattern where different features, such as friend request management and user searching, are encapsulated within dedicated service modules. This design is complemented by the use of repositories and services patterns for database interactions, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. The repository layer abstracts how data is fetched and persisted, while the service layer manages business logic. This architecture allows for easy scalability and maintainability, as well as facilitating testing by mocking the repository layer. The microservice also employs the use of background tasks queue, using Celery, to manage non-blocking operations for tasks such as sending notifications upon friend request updates or processing analytics data on user interactions, enhancing the overall performance and user experience of the social interaction features.

## CONTAINER NAME: frontend

### DESCRIPTION: Manages the user interface and serves the frontend for user interaction, presenting sports news, events, and ticket operations accessible via a web platform.
### PORTS: 8500:8550

### DESCRIPTION: 
The "frontend" container is responsible for managing the user interface of the OneSport system. Its primary purpose is to deliver the web experience for users by providing a seamless and interactive platform that encompasses sports news, event updates, and ticket operations. The container serves as the gateway for user interaction with the system, ensuring that all back-end services related to user authentication, news management, ticket management, favorites management, and social interaction are appropriately integrated and accessible to users through a unified and engaging web interface. It ensures that users can easily navigate and utilize the various features and functionalities offered by the system, all while maintaining a visually appealing and user-friendly design. The "frontend" container is crucial in ensuring user engagement and satisfaction by presenting content and actions in an organized and intuitive manner.

### PERSISTANCE EVALUATION
The "frontend" container does not need to store persistent data as its primary role is to manage the presentation layer and interface for user interaction. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the backend services, rendering the data it receives from other containers and services. As such, any persistence required, such as saving user preferences or states, would be managed by local storage or session storage techniques in the user's browser, rather than by the container itself.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS
The "frontend" container itself does not need to directly connect to external services. However, it will interact with backend containers to fetch data and perform operations. These backend services, like news_management and ticket_management, might have connections to external providers for retrieving news content or ticket availability, but these interactions are handled at the service level, not by the frontend. The frontend would utilize APIs exposed by these backend services to gather necessary data and facilitate user interactions.

### MICROSERVICES:

#### MICROSERVICE: ui_service
- TYPE: frontend
- DESCRIPTION: The microservice is responsible for delivering the web interface for user interactions. It encompasses the presentation of sports news, event updates, and ticket operations in a seamless and interactive manner. The service integrates with various backend services to ensure a coherent user experience and serves as the primary gateway for user engagement, maintaining a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
- PORTS: 8500
- TECHNOLOGICAL SPECIFICATION
The "ui_service" microservice will leverage modern frontend technologies to deliver a seamless user experience. The primary language to be used will be JavaScript, with React.js as the chosen framework due to its component-based architecture and ability to efficiently manage dynamic content updates. React.js also provides a rich ecosystem of libraries for handling state management, such as Redux, which could be employed if necessary to manage complex user interactions. Additionally, for styling and design consistency, libraries such as Styled Components or CSS-in-JS solutions can be utilized to provide responsive and visually appealing presentations. For development enhancement and module bundling, tools like Webpack or Vite may be included. Since this frontend microservice interfaces with various backend services through APIs, Axios or Fetch API will be essential for handling HTTP requests.
- SERVICE ARCHITECTURE
The "ui_service" adopts a Single Page Application (SPA) architecture pattern using React.js, enabling smooth transitions and interactions without needing to reload pages. It will use a component-based architecture, which promotes reusability, maintainability, and scalability by breaking down the UI into discrete units or components, each responsible for a specific piece of the user interface. One core component will handle interactions with the "api_gateway" microservice, which routes requests to various backend services. Components will be organized hierarchically, with a centralized routing system possibly implemented using React Router to manage navigation. State management can be achieved through React Context API or Redux if more complex state interactions are needed, ensuring the data flow is predictable. Hooks provided by React will be used for managing component lifecycle and side effects. The architecture also supports client-side caching through the browser's local storage or session storage to improve performance by reducing redundant network requests. Overall, the frontend microservice leverages modern web development practices to deliver a fast, intuitive, and engaging user experience.
