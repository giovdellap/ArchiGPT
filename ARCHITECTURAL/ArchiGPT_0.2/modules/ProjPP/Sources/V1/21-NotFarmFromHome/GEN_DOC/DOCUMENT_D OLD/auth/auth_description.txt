Service's Behaviour and Purpose:
The 'auth' service within the NFFH-Auth container is primarily responsible for handling authentication processes. This includes managing user credentials, generating and validating authentication tokens, and potentially managing user sessions. The service's functionality is implemented in Python, utilizing a set of specific libraries and frameworks to facilitate web-based authentication mechanisms.

- Deployment Technology: Docker (as indicated by the presence of a Dockerfile for containerization)

Note: The detailed functionalities such as token generation, session management, and credential verification mechanisms are implemented in the service logic contained within 'app.py'. The 'requirements.txt' file specifies the exact Python packages and versions required, ensuring a consistent environment for the service's operation. The Dockerfile outlines the steps for creating a Docker container for the service, emphasizing the service's deployment in an isolated and reproducible manner.
