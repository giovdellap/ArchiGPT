Service's Behaviour and Purpose:
The "client-fe" service is the front-end interface for clients or customers, facilitating interactions such as viewing products or services, placing orders, and managing profiles. It is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using Angular, providing a responsive and dynamic user experience that minimizes page reloads and enhances interactivity.

Technologies, Programming Languages, Frameworks, and Libraries:
- Programming Language: TypeScript, employed for its strong typing capabilities that improve code quality and maintainability in complex web applications.
- Front-end Framework: Angular. The `package.json` file lists the specific Angular version and key dependencies, reflecting the application's reliance on Angular for its modular architecture and rich feature set.

- Package Management: npm, as evidenced by the presence of `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, which manage the application's dependencies.
- Deployment: Docker. The `Dockerfile` outlines the steps for containerizing the application, ensuring a streamlined deployment process across various environments.
- Web Server: Nginx, configured via `nginx.conf`, optimizes the delivery of the Angular application's static files and supports advanced routing configurations.

The service's design emphasizes user experience, leveraging Angular's capabilities to build a highly interactive and efficient front-end.
