Service's Behaviour and Purpose:
The "client-be" service is a backend microservice designed to manage customer-related functionalities within the system. This includes, but is not limited to, customer registration, authentication, profile management, and possibly interactions with orders and other services. The application is structured around the Spring Boot framework, facilitating the development of easily deployable microservices with a focus on customer operations.

Technologies, Programming Languages, Frameworks, and Libraries:
- Programming Language: Java. This is evident from the use of .java files and the structure of the project, which adheres to Java's standard development practices.
- Framework: Spring Boot. The application's structure, with dedicated directories for controllers, services, repositories, and entities, strongly suggests the use of Spring Boot for its simplicity and comprehensive ecosystem that supports building microservices.
- Build Tool: Maven, as indicated by the presence of 'pom.xml'. Maven is used for dependency management, building, and testing of the application.
- Containerization: Docker. The presence of a Dockerfile within the project directory implies that Docker is used for deploying the service in a containerized environment, ensuring consistency across different deployment platforms.
- Database Interaction: The existence of entities and repositories suggests the service interacts with a database, using Spring Data JPA or similar technologies for object-relational mapping and data access.

The service's architecture is designed to be modular, with clear separation of concerns among different components, enabling scalable and maintainable development of customer-focused features.
