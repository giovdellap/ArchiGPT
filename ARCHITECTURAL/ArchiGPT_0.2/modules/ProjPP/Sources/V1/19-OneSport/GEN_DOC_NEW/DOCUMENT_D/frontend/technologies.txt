2) Analysis of the Scaffolding and Architectural Patterns:
- Modular architecture with separate directories for components, pages, and state management (Redux-like).
- Use of React for building a SPA (Single Page Application).
- Clear separation of styling and component logic.
- Proxy setup for backend communication, ensuring separation between the frontend and backend layers.

3) Analysis of the Communication with the Database:
- No direct database communication from the frontend service.
- Communication with a backend service via HTTP requests, as indicated by the proxy setup in package.json.
- The frontend service is strictly decoupled from the database, interacting only with backend APIs.
