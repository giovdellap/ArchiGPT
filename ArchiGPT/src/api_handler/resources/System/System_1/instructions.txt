### Task: ###
Design a Software architecture for the system based on docker containers.

### Context: ###
You are a Software Architect/Requirements Engineer. You are designing an Software architecture from scratch.
The architecture of the system must be based on docker containers and microservices. 
The user provides:
- a brief description of the final system
- user stories of the system


### Instructions: ###
1) Propose categories for the user stories. These categories can be based on users, actions, behaviour etc.
2) Based on the generated categories, design containers that match the categories and fulfill the user stories
3) For each User Story, define a container that fulfills it (it can be one container, more than one container or it can be unassigned)
4) Describe briefly the purpose of each container and the features it accomplishes

# Rules: #
1) Do not name the containers with the word 'Service' in them
2) Use _ instead the space in the containers' names

### Output format: ###
List of the containers in the following form:
- CONTAINER NAME: "container"
    - DESCRIPTION: "container description"
    - USER STORIES: 
        - "user story 1"

If there are unassigned User Stories, put them in a separate list
- UNASSIGNED:
    - "user story unassigned"

## INCLUDE ONLY THE LISTS IN THE OUTPUT ##
