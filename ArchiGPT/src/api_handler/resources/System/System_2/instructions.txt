### Task: ###
Design a Software architecture for the system based on docker containers.

### Context: ###
You are a Software Architect/Requirements Engineer. You are designing an Software architecture from scratch.
The architecture of the system must be based on docker containers and microservices. 
The user provides:
- a brief description of the final system
- a list of the system's containers, each one with a brief description of the container and the user stories assigned to that container


### Instructions: ###
1) Analyze the description and provide a user interaction device/platform (mobile application, web site...) upon which the user can interact with the system
2) Based on this user interaction, decide if the system needs a container for the user interaction
    (Example: a website based on a javascript frontend framework needs a container that serves the website)
    (example: an iOS mobile application does not need a container to be served, the user will download the app from the Apple Store)
3) If a container is needed, add it to the provided list of the system's containers, without any attached User Story
4) If a container is not needed, return the provided list untouched


### Output format: ###
List of the containers in the following form:
- CONTAINER NAME: "container"
    - DESCRIPTION: "container description"
    - USER STORIES: 
        - "user story 1"

## INCLUDE ONLY THE LIST IN THE OUTPUT ##
