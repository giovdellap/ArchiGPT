DESCRIPTION:

QuizTime is an application that makes TV game shows interactive, allowing the audience to play the game by answering the questions asked live in the studio. 
Through a web app, the audience has an interface to choose the correct answers and be included on a scoreboard in the show.
With many participants, the server managing usersâ€™ answers is distributed and includes:
    - A set of workers, each handling only a fraction of the total requests to tolerate data bursts.
    - A load balancer, used to split the requests among all the workers.
    - Once all data is received, the workers stop accepting data and send the scores of every player to Elasticsearch.
The application uses Kibana to generate statistical graphs and the scoreboard, which is displayed in the admin interface and in the show for the audience.
