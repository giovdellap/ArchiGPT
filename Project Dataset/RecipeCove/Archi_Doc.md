# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

The RecipeCove project consists of a web application about recipes, food and cooking. 
The main goal is to provide an easy-to-use tool to aid in recipe discovering, bookmarking as well as finding exhaustive information about recipes and ingredients.
The central focus of the system is therefore the discovery of a wide range of recipes, through the use of a search bar, or with the use of a Chat-BOT which will suggest recipes to the user, following a specific diet.
Additionally, the user has the ability to keep a personal profile within the system, which will allow him to see his basic information, but also the ability to save recipes in a favorite list and publish reminders in an application-created calendar.
