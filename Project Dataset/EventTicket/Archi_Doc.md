# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

The purpose of our project is to build a web application providing a set of services aimed at the management
and proposals of events and distribution of tickets.
The goal is provide to the users a way to discover events and buy or preorder tickets directly online. At the
same time the application allows also the eventsâ€™ managers to publish their events in order to promote them
and eventually to give the possibility to sell tickets of the event through the website.
