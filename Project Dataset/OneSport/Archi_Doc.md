### DESCRIPTION: 
The User_Management container is designed to handle all core functionalities related to user accounts within the OneSport platform. This includes the processes of registering for a new account, logging into an existing account, and securely logging out. Additionally, it manages user profile settings, allowing users to access and modify their personal information such as updating email addresses and passwords. It also provides the functionality to delete a user account altogether. This container ensures that user account data is handled securely and efficiently, contributing to a seamless user experience on the OneSport platform.

### PERSISTANCE EVALUATION
The User_Management container is integral for handling user-specific data, which necessitates persistent storage. It must store data relevant to user registration, login credentials (e.g., usernames, passwords), profile settings, and any changes or deletions made to user accounts. This data must be securely handled and readily accessible for user authentication, account updates, or deletions, ensuring consistent and reliable user experiences.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS
The User_Management container, given its function related strictly to user account management, does not inherently require connecting to any external services for its core operations of account management and authentication. However, integrations with external email service providers for purposes such as confirmation emails or password resets may be applicable if such functionality is desired to enhance user communication and security measures.

### PERSISTANCE EVALUATION
The News_Service container requires persistent storage to manage and tailor the user's experience effectively.

Storing news involves retaining titles, content, metadata like publication date and region-specific tagging, while user-specific data includes the list of favorite news items to facilitate adding and removing operations as described in the user stories.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS
This container needs to connect to external news provider services to fetch up-to-date and region-specific news content.

### PORTS: 
10200:10299

### DESCRIPTION: 
The Ticket_Service container is responsible for managing all aspects related to event tickets within the OneSport platform. It facilitates the display of available tickets for various sporting events, allowing users to browse and filter tickets based on region-specific criteria. The container enables users to add tickets to a personal collection for future purchase, and to manage (add or remove) these tickets as desired. This service is pivotal for users who plan to attend sports events and need an efficient way to handle their ticketing options, ensuring a smooth transaction from selection to purchase.

### PERSISTANCE EVALUATION
The Ticket_Service container needs to persistently store data regarding both the available tickets and user-specific collections of tickets. For the available tickets, data might include details such as event information, pricing, dates, and regional categorizations, which are essential for filtering and display based on user queries. Regarding user-specific collections, the container must store individual user preferences about the tickets they are interested in or plan to purchase. This data is crucial for allowing users to manage their collections, adding or deleting tickets as they revise their plans.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS
The Ticket_Service container may need to connect to external services that provide real-time access to ticketing information, especially if the sporting event tickets are managed through various external ticket providers or event management platforms. Integrating APIs from these services will enable the container to update and synchronize its ticket offerings with the latest availability and pricing updates. Furthermore, connections to payment gateways for handling transactions might also be necessary once tickets move from collection to the actual purchase phase.

### PORTS: 
10300:10399

### DESCRIPTION: 
The Social_Features container is designed to manage various aspects of social interaction within the OneSport platform.

This functionality not only enhances the user's social experience on the platform but also enables them to engage more personally with other sports enthusiasts. The container handles the addition and removal of friends, helping users curate their social circle within the OneSport environment.

### PERSISTANCE EVALUATION
The Social_Features container requires persistent storage to manage friend relationships effectively. It needs to store information about sent and received friend requests and the current status of these requests (e.g., pending, accepted, declined). Additionally, the container must maintain a list of friends for each user, which would include data such as user identifiers and relationship status. This data is essential for the container to fulfill its user stories related to managing social interactions and friend lists.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS
The Social_Features container does not inherently need to connect to any external services to fulfill its primary functionalities, related to managing friend requests and friend lists. Its operation is largely dependent on internal data and interactions with other internal services, such as User_Management, to retrieve user-specific information when necessary. No external APIs or third-party services are necessary for the primary operations of sending, accepting, or removing friends within the OneSport platform.

### MICROSERVICES:

It is the entry point for carrying out all user interactions described in the user stories and ensures that they are intuitive and efficient, enhancing the overall user experience on the platform.

### PERSISTANCE EVALUATION
The Frontend container does not require storage of persistent data, as its primary function is to serve as the user interface layer. This container presents data processed and managed by backend services and maintains no state that needs persistence beyond user session management through cache or temporary local/session storage for improved user experience.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS
The Frontend container requires connections to other internal microservices such as User_Management, News_Service, Ticket_Service, and Social_Features to request and retrieve data accordingly. These services provide APIs that the Frontend container calls to allow users to perform actions like login, view news, manage tickets, and social interactions. Although primarily dependent on internal services, it might also incorporate connections to external APIs for additional functionalities like maps, social media sharing, or to fetch external content which enhances the information provided within the platform.
